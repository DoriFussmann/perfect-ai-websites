Core Web Vitals measure whether a page feels stable and responsive after it is eligible to rank. They do not replace crawl and index work; they describe experience on URLs that already exist in the index.

## The three field metrics

Largest Contentful Paint tracks when the main content appears. Interaction to Next Paint tracks how quickly the page reacts. Cumulative Layout Shift tracks whether the layout jumps while someone is reading or tapping.

## How to diagnose without vanity lab scores

Use field data for the URL group that matters, then reproduce the slowest template in the lab. Hero images, web fonts, and third-party tags are the usual LCP and INP suspects; injected banners are the usual CLS suspects.

## Where Things Stand
<!-- WHERE-THINGS-STAND:START -->
As of August 2026, INP remains the interaction metric that catches slow event handlers the older FID metric missed, and field data still outranks a single lab run.
<!-- WHERE-THINGS-STAND:END -->

## Key Takeaways

- Treat Core Web Vitals as field metrics on indexed templates, not as a substitute for crawl work.
- Diagnose LCP, INP, and CLS separately; they rarely share a single fix.
- Reproduce the slow template in the lab after the field URL group is identified.
